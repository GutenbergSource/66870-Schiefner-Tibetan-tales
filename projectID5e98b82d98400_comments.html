<HTML><BODY>This collection of Tibetan tales is translated from a German translation of a Tibetan book, the Kanjur, but is ultimately derived from Sanskrit originals, such as the Jataka or the <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/40588">Kathá Sarit Ságara</a>. This work has all the hallmarks of a 19th century scientific work: lots and lots of footnotes, and many accented letters, such as macrons and under-dots. Please be aware of these accents, and encode them following the standard practices.

<p>Have fun!
